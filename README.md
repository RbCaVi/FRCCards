## Gameplay
Decks:
Each player in a game of FRC: The Card Game must have a deck with 30-40 cards as well as one team card. 
You may have as many other cards as you want, but you may not have more than three copies of a card in one deck.



Gameplay:
At the beginning of a game of FRC: The Card Game, each player is assigned 4000 points and begins the game with playing their team card as well as drawing 4 cards from the top of their deck. A coin is flipped to determine whose turn goes first.
The player who goes first skips the draw and scoring phases of their first turn.

Each turn of FRC: The Card Game has 5 phases:
- Draw
- Median
- Main
- Scoring
- End

### Draw Phase
During the Draw phase, a player must draw a single card from the top of their deck (unless otherwise stated).
If a player is unable to draw a card, they lose.

### Median Phase
Nothing occurs during the Median phase unless a card's effect specifically states that it starts during the median phase of a player’s turn.

### Main Phase
During the Main phase of a player’s turn, the player may play cards on their side of the playing field. The player may play any number of Mentor and/or event cards assuming there are open places on the field for them. Only one student card may be played per turn (unless otherwise stated). You are allowed to play as many robot cards as you want on your turn so long as their build requirements are met and there are open space for them on the playing field.

Robots can also be switched between offensive and defensive positions in the Main phase.

### Scoring Phase
During the Scoring phase, a player may choose to play offense against the opposing player with the following rules:
You must have a Robot(s) on the field which is capable of scoring and is in an offensive position.

Each Robot may score once in a turn.

A Robot can score on one opposing Robot.

If you score on an opponent’s robot that is in an offensive position and your robot’s offensive stat is higher than their offense, their robot is retired and the difference of the two robot’s offense stats is subtracted from the other player’s points.

If you score on an opponent’s robot that is in a defensive position and your robot’s offensive stat is higher than their defense, their robot is retired but no points are deducted.

If you score on an opponent’s robot that is in a offensive or defensive position and your robot’s offensive stat is lower than their respective stat, your robot is retired and the difference of the two robot’s offense stats is subtracted from the your points

If scoring occurs and the applicable stats of the two robots are equal, neither robot is retired and no points are deducted

If you attempt to score and there are no robot(s) on your opponent's side of the field then your robot’s offensive stat is subtracted from your opponent’s points

Each of your robots may only attempt to score once during your scoring phase

### End Phase
If a player ends their turn with more than 8 cards, they must discard from their hand until only 8 cards remain.


If a player’s score reaches or drops below 0 at any point, the game is over and that player loses. If both players are at or below 0, the one with less points loses.

You may only play one student card per turn(unless otherwise stated)
Mentor & Event cards:
Mentor cards(Green) and event cards(Purple) each have one or more “Effect”


The Effect(s) listed are active the moment they are played (unless otherwise stated)
Both Mentor cards and Event cards are played in the same way
The difference between the two is that Mentor cards are permanent until retired by another card effect but Event cards are automatically retired once their effect is no longer active(for reference, the event card -Rapid React “Hangar”- is retired once it’s effect, which lasts 2 turns, has gone up)
Robot cards:
Robot cards are indicated by their red border and have an “Offense” “Defense” and “Attributes” category and may also have an “Effects” category as well

Offense: is the attack power of a robot
Defense: is the protective power of the robot
Attributes: all robots have Attributes that must be met with corresponding “Skill”(s) from the students used to create the robot. For reference, KRAB has a pneumatics and a neutral attribute, meaning to create it, you must use at least one pneumatics student, and one student with any attribute. When a robot card is created, you must put the student cards used to create it underneath the card forming the robot’s “drive team”.
