Name: The name of the student, mentor, robot, team, etc.

Description: A description of the student, mentor, robot, team, etc.
Tag & Border: Each card has its own Tag(the colored circle with the letter) and Border(the color surrounding the card) that indicate the card’s type.
Card Types:
Team Cards:
Team cards are indicated by a blue border and always have an “Effect” listed

Team cards are always played at the beginning of a game. 
Only one team card may be played in a game
Student Cards:
Student cards are indicated by a Yellow border and have an “Skill” and a “Effect”

The card’s “Skill” determines what robot cards the student card can be used to summon(skills include: Design, Programming, Pneumatics, Swerve, Climbing, Shooting).
The card’s “Effect” determines if the student card has any extra abilities.
You may only play one student card per turn(unless otherwise stated)
Mentor & Event cards:
Mentor cards(Green) and event cards(Purple) each have one or more “Effect”


The Effect(s) listed are active the moment they are played (unless otherwise stated)
Both Mentor cards and Event cards are played in the same way
The difference between the two is that Mentor cards are permanent until retired by another card effect but Event cards are automatically retired once their effect is no longer active(for reference, the event card -Rapid React “Hangar”- is retired once it’s effect, which lasts 2 turns, has gone up)
Robot cards:
Robot cards are indicated by their red border and have an “Offense” “Defense” and “Attributes” category and may also have an “Effects” category as well

Offense: is the attack power of a robot
Defense: is the protective power of the robot
Attributes: all robots have Attributes that must be met with corresponding “Skill”(s) from the students used to create the robot. For reference, KRAB has a pneumatics and a neutral attribute, meaning to create it, you must use at least one pneumatics student, and one student with any attribute. When a robot card is created, you must put the student cards used to create it underneath the card forming the robot’s “drive team”. If a robot card is retired, you must also retire one of the student cards on its drive team. The remaining students on the drive team are returned to the player’s student body.
Effects: Effects are any additional ability a card may have.
Decks:
Each player in a game of FRC: The Card Game must have a deck with 30-40 cards as well as one team card. 
You may have as many of any other card as you want, but you may not have more than three copies of a card in one deck.

Gameplay:
At the beginning of a game of FRC: The Card Game, each player is assigned 4000 points and begins the game with playing their team card as well as drawing 4 cards from the top of their deck. A coin is flipped to determine whose turn goes first.
The player who goes first skips the draw and scoring phases of their first turn

Each turn of FRC: The Card Game has 5 phases
Draw Phase: The turn player draws one card.
Median Phase: Nothing specific occurs, but it exists for card effects that activate or end during this specific phase.
Main Phase: This is the phase where you can perform most of your actions.
Scoring Phase: If you want to attack , this is when you do it.
End Phase: The turn player ends their turn.

Draw Phase:
During the draw phase, a player may draw a single card from the top of their deck(unless otherwise stated)

Median Phase:
Nothing occurs during the median phase unless a card effect(s) specifically states that it activates/terminates during the median phase of ___’s turn.

Main Phase:
During the main phase of a player’s turn, the player may lay cards on their side of the playing field. You may play as many Mentor and/or event cards as you want assuming there is an open place on the field for it. You are only allowed to play one student card once per turn(unless otherwise stated). You are allowed to play as many robot cards as you want on your turn so long as its build requirements are met and there is an open space for it on the playing field.

Scoring Phase:
During the Scoring phase, a player may choose to play offense against the opposing player with the following rules:
You must have a robot(s) on the field with the capability of scoring and it is an offensive position

You may score on any robot on your opponent's side of the field

If you score on an opponent’s robot that is in an offensive position and your robot’s offensive stat is higher than their offense, their robot is retired and the difference of the two robot’s offense stats is subtracted from the  other player’s points.

If you score on an opponent’s robot that is in a defensive position and your robot’s offensive stat is higher than their defense, their robot is retired but no points are deducted.

If you score on an opponent’s robot that is in a offensive or defensive position and your robot’s offensive stat is lower than their respective stat, your robot is retired and the difference of the two robot’s offense stats is subtracted from the your points

If scoring occurs and the applicable stats of the two robots are equal, neither robots are retired and no points are deducted

If you attempt to score and there are no robot(s) on your opponent's side of the field then your robot’s offensive stat is subtracted from your opponent’s points

Each of your robots may only attempt to score once during your scoring phase

If a player’s score reaches or drops below 0(during the scoring phase or otherwise), the game is over and the player with no remaining points loses.

End Phase:
During the end phase, all other phases are completed and cards that activate/retire during this phase do so. If you end your turn with more than 8 cards, you must discard from your hand until only 8 cards remain. Your turn is now completed and your opponent begins his draw phase.

Gameplay field:
Each side of the field is structured in this way:

Each player is given 1 slot for their deck, 1 slot for their retirement pile, 1 slot for their team card, 1 elongated slot for their student body(you are allowed to have as many student cards in this slot as you have played), 3 slots for robot placement, and 5 slots for mentor and event cards.
